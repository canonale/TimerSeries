TimerSeries
=======

TimerSeries is a simple app for workout with series. I decided to make this app when I was doing rehab to cure my knee.
This app helped me to do work that the doctor said me.
After, I thought that this app can be helpful for other people and uploaded it in Google Play. I revised some issues and made the actual version.

Currently, the project no receives more improvements, but the users need it. They contact to me for this.

I think that the community can continue to develop this app and give answers to users.
